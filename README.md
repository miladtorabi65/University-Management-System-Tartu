# University Management System

## Overview  
The **University Management System** is a desktop application designed to streamline student enrollment, faculty management, grading, and course administration. Built with **Python, SQLite, and Tkinter**, this project was developed as part of my application to the **Master's in Software Engineering at the University of Tartu**, where I was later admitted.  

This system functions as an **admission office program**, allowing administrative staff to:  
âœ… **Register students and teachers**  
âœ… **Offer subjects for each semester**  
âœ… **Enroll students in specific courses**  
âœ… **Manage grading and student progress**  

Additionally, the system supports **Excel file export**, enabling staff to generate reports efficiently.
