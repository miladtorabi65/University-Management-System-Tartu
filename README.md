This project, more than 1200 lines of codes, is an admission office program in which its user(the admission office staff) can register students,teachers,and offer subjects in each semester.In adition,they can enroll each student in a particular subject and mark them as well. The reports of the program are Excel Files that can be  exported from the program.Please make sure to download the image files of the landing page backgrounds(it is a zip file named "UIphotos"). The program has three main parts: 1-its database(SQLITE), 2-its back in python ,and 3-its UI was coded in Tkinter. I made my best to construct database and its tables to retrieve and insert data as efficient as possible(through the use of many to many,one to many, and one to one relationships for database).
